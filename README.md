# Ally-Code-Challenge- Chris Vere

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my challenge. Here are a couple notes regarding my work on the challenge.

The page is resposive. I would normally add more breakpoints to the page, but with such a simple page design I kept it to a minimum.

I wrote all my CSS in SASS and used CodeKit to concatenate and compile my .scss files. I would normally output minified CSS, but I left it uncompressed for easier review. The same goes for the JavaScript I wrote. I also included sourcemap files and I left in the sourcemap markers within the compiled CSS.

I do know how to use jQuery quite well, I began using it about 6 years ago. However I chose to use raw JavaScript for this project. I have been using jQuery less frequently lately as I feel like the modern DOM API can do many of the things jQuery can, but without having to load an entire library.

I used no plugins on this project, but I did conditionally load a couple polyfills to ensure IE9 could use things like element.classList amd element.dataset. jQuery would have silimilar 'polyfills' built into its core, so I felt no-harm done.

I am aware the off-canvas navigation for small screens does not work in IE9, but I feel that should be OK since no devices are running IE9.

I tested the site in the following browsers:

- Chrome- Latest version on Mac, PC
- FireFox- Latest version on Mac, PC
- Safari- Mac, iPhone 5, iPad Air, last iOS
- IE9

Unfortunately, I do not have access at home to Android devices or newer versions or IE.

Thanks again,
Chris Vere
